# Prediciting high school graduation rate of a cohort based on holistic data of the student population and school.

What do variables about:
- the broader structure of a school
- the experience of previous cohorts
- the freshmen, sophomore and junior year experience of rising seniors
tell us about the graduating % of rising seniors?

Data was gathered from https://www.isbe.net/pages/illinois-state-report-card-data.aspx
I have collected end of year data for the following academic years:
- 2018/19
- 2017/18
- 2016/17
- 2015/16
- 2014/15
- 2013/14
- 2012/13

I will look at the following cohorts for training the data:

- Class of 2017
- Class of 2016
- Class of 2015
- Class of 2014
- Class of 2013

I will run validation on 
- Class of 2018

My test set with be 
- Class of 2019

The goal is to predict the 4-year high school graduation rate for this cohort.
